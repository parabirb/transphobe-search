# transphobe-search
trans techbros have created plenty of lists of transphobes, but don't let you readily search them.

so, in the interest of transparency, i've created this tool to allow you to search their databases
**without** intalling their extensions.

this website lets you readily search the lists of two popular extensions:
1. soupcan (by bethylamine)
2. shinigami eyes

no data is sent to either bethylamine or the creator of shinigami eyes during the search process.

feel free to use this for whatever you want. checking if someone's a transphobe under the (arguably arbitrary) criteria of beth or shinigami eyes, checking if someone's trans friendly, seeing what insane things are going on over there (like marking random trans people as transphobic), etc. i don't really care.
